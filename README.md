# Hello WORLD👋
## This is my first terminal practice 👨🏽‍💻
 The MarkDowm will help me to give a nicer and easier to understand style to this.✨

## About  me
I am a young man passionate about programming, I like sneakers, in fact, I take care of my sneakers so they don't get damaged. I love spending time with my mother and my girlfriend, they are my main motivation to continue navigating this gigantic world of programming, and I know I can give them many things that right now I couldn't, because they believe in me.❤️‍🔥
